# Immigration as the primary factor of increased violence and crime rates in European Union countries
This project aims to prove the thesis that immigration is the primary factor behind the increase in violence and 
crime rates in European Union countries. It is based on facts rather than assumptions. 
Proving this thesis is the goal in itself; however, the causes and solutions are also presented because this issue 
is very complex and cannot be treated simplistically.
